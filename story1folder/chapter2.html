        EXT. FOG-COVERED STREETS - DUSK

        ${name}, compelled by an unseen force, emerges into the fog-shrouded town. The air is thick, and the streetlights cast eerie shadows on the cobblestone streets. Echoes of distant whispers fill the air as they wander, the town seemingly alive with a presence of its own.
        
        The fog becomes denser, reducing visibility. ${name}'s steps are hesitant, each one echoing louder than the last. Shadows dance on the edges of their vision, hinting at hidden terrors.
        
        Turning a corner, ${name} encounters reflections of their pastâ€”ghostly apparitions mirroring their guilt. Faces of those they wronged materialize, accusing stares haunting them as they walk. The weight of their actions becomes palpable.
        
        The whispers intensify, echoing fragments of their memories and regrets. ${name} stumbles upon a forgotten playground where laughter once echoed, now replaced by ghostly giggles that send shivers down their spine.
        
        In the distance, a flickering streetlight reveals a mysterious figure, barely visible through the thick fog. ${name} follows, the figure leading them deeper into the heart of Silent Hill, where their fears and guilt intertwine in a surreal dance.
