        INT. ABANDONED MANSION - NIGHT

        ${name}, guided by the elusive figure, arrives at an ominous abandoned mansion. Its dilapidated grandeur looms in the darkness, a silent witness to forgotten secrets. The air inside is stifling, and the floorboards creak under ${name}'s cautious steps.
        
        Exploring the mansion, ${name} stumbles upon a room adorned with an ancient mirror. Its ornate frame seems to whisper promises of revelations. Hesitant, ${name} gazes into the mirror, their reflection initially mundane but gradually distorting into grotesque forms.
        
        Suddenly, the room transforms. Shadows detach from the walls, taking on nightmarish shapes that mirror ${name}'s innermost fears. The mirror becomes a portal to ${name}'s darkest thoughts, manifesting anxieties in twisted, tangible forms.
        
        As ${name} struggles to break free, the reflections intensify. Each mirror in the mansion becomes a portal to a different facet of ${name}'s troubled psyche. Faces of those they hurt, moments of regret, and surreal nightmares converge, trapping them in a kaleidoscope of guilt and horror.
        
        The mansion seems to pulsate with an otherworldly energy. ${name} is compelled to confront the twisted reflections of their own making, as the boundary between reality and nightmare blurs within the haunted walls of Silent Hill.
