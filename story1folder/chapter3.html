    <h1>Chapter 3: The Mirror's Curse</h1>
    <p>INT. ABANDONED MANSION - NIGHT</p>
    <p>
        Rusty, guided by the elusive figure, arrives at an ominous abandoned mansion. Its dilapidated grandeur looms in the darkness, a silent witness to forgotten secrets. The air inside is stifling, and the floorboards creak under Rusty's cautious steps.
        
        Exploring the mansion, Rusty stumbles upon a room adorned with an ancient mirror. Its ornate frame seems to whisper promises of revelations. Hesitant, Rusty gazes into the mirror, his reflection initially mundane but gradually distorting into grotesque forms.
        
        Suddenly, the room transforms. Shadows detach from the walls, taking on nightmarish shapes that mirror Rusty's innermost fears. The mirror becomes a portal to his darkest thoughts, manifesting his anxieties in twisted, tangible forms.
        
        As Rusty struggles to break free, the reflections intensify. Each mirror in the mansion becomes a portal to a different facet of his troubled psyche. Faces of those he hurt, moments of regret, and surreal nightmares converge, trapping him in a kaleidoscope of guilt and horror.
        
        The mansion seems to pulsate with an otherworldly energy. Rusty is compelled to confront the twisted reflections of his own making, as the boundary between reality and nightmare blurs within the haunted walls of Silent Hill.</p>
