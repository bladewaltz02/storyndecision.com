        INT. DARK ALLEYWAYS - TWILIGHT

        ${name}, still haunted by the reflections in the mansion, emerges onto dark and narrow alleyways. The twisted streets seem to rearrange themselves with each step, creating a disorienting maze that echoes their inner turmoil.
        
        Flickering streetlights cast long shadows, and the fog morphs into shifting, amorphous shapes. ${name} navigates through the labyrinthine alleys, each turn leading them to manifestations of their deepest fears.
        
        As they venture deeper, the walls close in, and ghostly whispers echo louder. Figures, distorted and menacing, lurk in the shadows, forcing ${name} to confront the shadows of their own creation.
        
        Sudden flashes of their past torment themâ€”moments they wish to forget. The air becomes dense with an oppressive weight as the alleyways seem to fold upon themselves, trapping ${name} in a never-ending loop of fear and regret.
        
        The ground beneath their feet feels uncertain, and the walls seem to breathe. ${name}'s pulse quickens, their every step echoing in the suffocating silence. The maze of shadows becomes a relentless journey through their own psyche, a nightmarish purgatory within the heart of Silent Hill.
