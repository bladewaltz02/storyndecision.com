    <h1>Chapter 4: Maze of Shadows</h1>
    <p>INT. DARK ALLEYWAYS - TWILIGHT</p>
    <p>
        Rusty, still haunted by the reflections in the mansion, emerges onto dark and narrow alleyways. The twisted streets seem to rearrange themselves with each step, creating a disorienting maze that echoes his inner turmoil.
        
        Flickering streetlights cast long shadows, and the fog morphs into shifting, amorphous shapes. Rusty navigates through the labyrinthine alleys, each turn leading him to manifestations of his deepest fears.
        
        As he ventures deeper, the walls close in, and ghostly whispers echo louder. Figures, distorted and menacing, lurk in the shadows, forcing Rusty to confront the shadows of his own creation.
        
        Sudden flashes of his past torment himâ€”moments he wishes to forget. The air becomes dense with an oppressive weight as the alleyways seem to fold upon themselves, trapping Rusty in a never-ending loop of fear and regret.
        
        The ground beneath his feet feels uncertain, and the walls seem to breathe. Rusty's pulse quickens, his every step echoing in the suffocating silence. The maze of shadows becomes a relentless journey through his own psyche, a nightmarish purgatory within the heart of Silent Hill.</p>
