        INT. ${name.toUpperCase()}'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

        ${name}, disoriented from the maze of shadows, finds themselves standing before the decaying remains of their childhood home. The once-familiar structure now stands as a dilapidated shell, haunted by memories they tried to bury.
        
        Each creaking floorboard beneath their weight resounds with echoes of the past. As ${name} explores the desolate rooms, they are confronted by vivid recollectionsâ€”happy family dinners, laughter that once filled the halls, and the warmth of a love that has long since faded.
        
        Yet, with every step, the atmosphere shifts. Walls close in, portraits transform into grotesque caricatures, and the air grows heavy with a sense of impending doom. The rooms seem to warp, revealing hidden corners where shadows of unresolved conflicts linger.
        
        ${name} discovers a locked room at the end of the hallway. The key, a metaphor for the secrets they've kept buried, materializes in their trembling hands. As they unlock the door, a flood of haunting memories rushes forth, challenging their attempts to escape the ghosts of their past.
        
        Silent Hill, in its relentless pursuit, forces ${name} to confront the ghosts within the very walls that once provided sanctuary. The childhood home becomes a battleground of emotions, a reflection of the shattered innocence that paved the way for the nightmarish descent that now unfolds.
